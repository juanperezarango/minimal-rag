### Minimal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Demo

This repository contains a minimal Python implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using TF-IDF retrieval and a Hugging Face language model.

It demonstrates how to:

- Retrieve relevant documents

- Build a grounded prompt

- Generate cited answers with an LLM

- Validate output quality

This project is intended for learning and experimentation, not production use.
